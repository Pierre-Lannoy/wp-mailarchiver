**MailArchiver** is a tool that allows you to:

* catch emails sent by WordPress itself or plugins;
* enrich them with details regarding their sending;
* archive them in the WordPress database and/or send them to external services for logging and alerting;
* view (and filter) archived emails in the WordPress database.

It supports multisite archive delegation (see FAQ) and contains many features to help to protect personal information (user pseudonymization, IP obfuscation, etc.).

At this time, **MailArchiver** can archive emails:

* to its internal archiving storage and viewer;
* to local or network storage (with file rotation);
* to Imap servers, like GMail, Gandi, OVH or Outlook.Com;
* to external storage services, like Elasticsearch, Elastic Cloud, Loki or Grafana Cloud;
* to external alerting services, like Pushover or Slack;
* to external testing & previewing services, like Litmus, MailerCheck or Email on Acid;
* to external logging services, like Logentries / insightOps or Loggly;
* to system loggers, like Syslog or Fluentd.

**MailArchiver** supports an extensive set of WP-CLI commands to:

* decrypt a previously encrypted mail body - see `wp help m-archive decrypt` for details;
* toggle on/off main settings - see `wp help m-archive settings` for details;
* manage archivers (list, start, pause, clean, purge, remove, add and set) - see `wp help m-archive archiver` for details;
* view available archiver types (list and describe) - see `wp help m-archive type` for details.
